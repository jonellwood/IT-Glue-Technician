# IT Glue Getting Started: Introduction

## A Partnership

Our Core Purpose, Freeing Minds™, defines perfectly why we exist. 

By removing the burden of memorizing processes and documentation, we allow people to focus on more valuable and inspiring initiatives. We release your leadership to focus on growing and improving your business, rather than worrying about whether the information is complete or accessible.

We commit to being your partner through this journey of documentation. 

## Blog & Social Media

We're going to assume that, like us, you love the idea of having amazing documentation. If you are curious to learn more about some of our best practices and perhaps ideas you could implement in your organization connect with us Twitter, Facebook or check out our Blog where we highlight stories about IT Glue.

## Suggest a Feature

**Help us build a better product!**

If you have a great idea for a new feature, you can submit it for evaluation by Product Management. We welcome, and consider, every feature request submitted by the user community of IT Glue.

**Access the FEATURE REQUEST portal**

To access the feature request portal, go to the top right of IT Glue, click your name to display the drop-down menu, and then click Suggest a Feature.

This logs you into the feature submission portal (itglue.ideas.aha.io) where you can view and vote on ideas submitted by the user community or submit your own ideas. Through voting, Product Managers can see how much support ideas are getting from the user community. Votes don’t guarantee development, but they help with decision-making.

Take a browse through the **Recent, Trending**, or **Popular** ideas. 

You can also see a history of your contributions using the left navigation pane: *My ideas, My votes*, and *My subscriptions*.

**Once we receive and review the idea, the status will be updated by our Product Management team. Use the "Filter by status" view in the left column to see what we're planning to ship.**

Before submitting an idea make sure you: **Search** for your idea, maybe someone already had the same idea!

## Getting Support

Wherever you are in the app, support isn't far away.

## Security Overview

We believe that **trust** is the key to our existence; our reason for being. 

In today's world we know that you entrust us with your important, confidential intellectual property for which you care for.  To ensure that your data is secure. IT Glue is a trusted platform with **security** always at the forefront of our design.

To ensure you know we mean it, we are  SOC 2 compliant certified since March 2018. This means that our security infrastructure and procedures are tested and audited by third parties on a regular basis.. We have always lived by a comprehensive set of security systems based on industry best practices, including ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS.

If you would like a copy of our SOC 2 report, have your admin send in a request to our Support Team in either the form of a support ticket or by emailing **support@itglue.com**.

### Encryption at IT Glue

We know how important it is to be trusted with your confidential information and that is why we take the responsibility for securing your passwords and all other information a step further. 

Passwords are encrypted with AES-256-bit encryption, including 2048-bit RSA public key, unique keys for each customer, and secure random keys that are unique to each password. Unencrypted versions of passwords are never written to disk. They are encrypted and also decrypted as soon as they are received/sent by our server.

Similarly, all data sent between your web browser and IT Glue is encrypted. IT Glue has partnered with AWS to provide an application with world class security and uptime.

### Ok, but what about Internal Security?

We care about security in all corners of our company, you will see each of our spaces also act in accordance to SOC 2 compliance certifications. We ensure our people and our internal processes also reflect how much we care for your trust. 

You might also want to know that staff at IT Glue cannot access your data or account. In certain circumstances, our team may need to impersonate your account to troubleshoot issues you report. In this circumstance, your explicit written permission is **required** and only select staff will have impersonation abilities.

	- Terms of Service - https://www.itglue.com/terms/

	- For more details about password security and encryption read our Knowledge Base article about password security and encryption.


## Date & Time

IT Glue offers some functionality that is dependent on your time zone. You will want to make sure that it reflects the place you are in or your preferred time zone.

We follow the internationally recognized ISO Date and Time format (ISO 8601) to standardize the date and time representation on the platform. ISO Date and Time format is the best representation as it is accurate and universally understandable. ISO 8601 sets out an internationally agreed way to represent dates and times below:

	- May 12, 2022 is represented as 2022-05-12
	- 9:15am is represented as 09:15:00

You might want to know that our default time zone is UTC, Universal Time Coordinated, so if you want to change it, click through these slides to make the change:

### Editing your time zone

**1. My Settings**: Click on your name in the top-right corner of the IT Glue interface and select **MY SETTINGS** from the drop-down menu.

**2. Edit Profile**: Then **SELECT** a new time zone in the drop-down menu. Lastly, click on **SAVE** to ensure your changes are saved.

You can always change this!

If at some point in the future you move somewhere else or you just need to change it, you can just come back here or refer to our Knowledge Base for step by step guidance. 

#### There are some exceptions:

You might also want to know there are 2 exceptions to the format we just shared above. There are a few instances in the platform where dates and time are displayed in human-readable format. 

Here are the two instances in which you will see this happen:
	- **Activity Log** captures a slightly different format so you are able to read it easily
	- **Revision History** captures a slightly different format so you are able to read it easily

#### Things to remember:

Each user will need to set their own timezone based on their geographical location.

The date and time format cannot be changed in an account. Only the ISO 8601 standard can be used.

## Logging in with MFA

### What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Multi-Factor Authentication offers extended security to ensure the validity of login sessions into IT Glue. IT Glue uses a one-time password generated by a mobile device to achieve this.

By using MFA, IT Glue can more accurately verify an individual's identity. This is because the one-time password requires access to ***something a person has*** (a specific mobile phone) as well as ***something a person knows*** (their static password).

IT Glue relies on the current time to identify the validity of a one-time password. This means that your mobile device's time must be accurate. We recommend setting your device to automatically obtain the time from the cellular network or a time server to ensure you can access IT Glue with MFA.

## Changing and Resetting your Password

### Changing your Password

**1. Edit Profile**: Log into your IT Glue account. Click on your name in the top-right corner of any screen and select **Edit Profile** from the drop-down menu.

**2. Enter New Password**: **ENTER** and **RE-ENTER** your new password in the Change and Password Confirmation field. **ENTER** your current password to authorize the change. Lastly, click **Save** to change your password for IT Glue. 

Summary: You can change your passwords as many times in IT Glue with this simple process.

### Resetting your Forgotten Password

For those occasions when you or a colleague forget their password, there is a simple way to regain access to IT Glue. 

1. Navigate to your login page (e.g. mycompany.itglue.com).

2. Click the **Forgot your password** link.

3. Enter your email address and click **Send reset instructions**.

4. Check your email and follow the reset instructions provided to you.

! IT Glue Support cannot reset a password on your behalf. You must use the password reset options found on your login page.

Clicking the green *Support* button at the bottom-right corner of the screen will take you to the Knowledge Base. From there you can **submit technical support requests. **


### Where would you find? 

...your own orginazation? = In Organizations

...particular asset type for all clients? = in the Global tab

...if you know the name of an asset, where you find it the quickest? = in the Search Bar.

## Search Basics

We have built our tool so it gives you the chance to become more efficient, let us walk you through some of the things you could do do exactly that. 

### The search bar
The search bar is located on the top-right corner of every IT Glue page.

Search gives you the ability to quickly access all assets you have access to. As you start typing keywords into the search bar, results begin to appear below. Use your up and down arrow keys to navigate through the previews. 

You can also access search by pressing "Q" or "/" on your keyboard.

When launching a search within an organization using one of the search hotkeys, the search will be filtered to that organization. Should you desire to search globally, you can toggle your search at any point by pressing Alt+G (Option+G for Mac).

### Controlling Search Results

Using keyboard shortcuts to launch your quick search makes you even more efficient. Review all the available keyboard shortcuts here or in our Search KB article.

! You can actually see all the shortcuts by pressing the following while in IT Glue: Windows: `Alt + /` Mac: `Option + /`

For more information review our Search best practices Knowledge Base article for details on how to control your search results:

- Narrowing your search results

- Partial word (fuzzy) searching

- Refining searches by short name

#### Here are some tips for you: 

- If you are viewing a particular organization, search is limited to just that particular organization by using the quick search keyboard shortcuts (excluding the "/" key) and can be toggled using keyboard shortcuts.

- Clicking the Search bar or triggering search with the "/" key will always trigger a global search. This can be toggled using keyboard shortcuts when you are doing so from within an organization.

- The first results of your search are associated with the Name field of the IT Glue asset.

- Filtering your search can help you narrow down your results.

## Organizations in IT Glue

### What is an Organization?

Organizations are companies, businesses, and other entities you do business with. These are comparable to "Companies" in ConnectWise Manage or "Accounts" in Autotask PSA. Organizations are used to contain all information and assets for your clients, your client's vendors, and your own organization.

Clicking on **Organizations** from the top navigation takes you to a screen that links to all the organizations that you have access to, as well as your favorite organizations. You can also search organizations from this screen. 

***Clicking on an organization's name takes you to it.***

#### Here are some tips for you

- You can favorite organizations by clicking the star icon.

- Organizations are where you document information about your clients and vendors.

- Your company also has its own organization where you can document your assets and procedures.

## Organization Sidebar

The Organization sidebar appears on the left side of the screen when you are viewing an organization. Use it to navigate between asset types within that organization. If at any point you want to switch back to another organization, you will need to click on Organizations once again and navigate to your desired organization.

Below we see a good example for how a sidebar looks like. The sidebar includes links to assets such as Contacts, Configurations, and Passwords for the organization you are viewing. 

*An example of an organization sidebar. This sidebar has been customized by an account administrator and may be structured differently in your IT Glue account.*

#### Changes to your Sidebar

The sidebar can be customized by a Manager or an Administrator. Try to design the best order with your deployment team and with your actual users. Remember who this set up serves and ask them questions how you could make it better?

In the meantime, here is how some account administrators will group assets:


| Group Heading   | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Assets     | Your most frequent accessed assets: configurations, contacts, documents, domains, SLL, locations, and passwords                                             |
| Apps & Services | Contains flexible assets (e.g Applications, LAN, File Sharing), which provide comprehensive information about your managed services, in a structured format.|
| Administration  | Non-technical information such as sales/finance, licensing, and operation information                                                                       |



#### Where to change the sidebar?

**Customize your sidebar**

Simply navigate to the Account tab and Select Customize Sidebar. 

You will now be able to play around with your options by dragging and dropping them. 

## Viewing Global Lists

### Using the Global Lists

The Global list view can be accessed from the top navigation bar and is accessible to all user roles except Lite.

You can learn more about the following sections of the Viewing global lists in our knowledge base but for now check these short descriptions out:

- **Global Assets**: The **Global > Assets** screen allows you to see a comprehensive listing of each asset category across all organizations you have access to.
- **Global Completion**: The **Global > Completion** screen allows you to see a high-level view of your team's progress in documenting your clients.
- **Global Expirations**: The **Global > Expirations** screen allows you to access all assets that have an expiration date for all organizations you have access to.

#### Here is a tip for you:

Flexible assets can be added to the **Global > Expirations** screen by modifying the flexible asset design to include a date field. 

Only an Administrator can make this change, more details can be found in our KB article, Flexible asset field definitions.
